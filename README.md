# Freecell-in-Prolog
In 2019 I made the game freecell in prolog for some reason...  
  
# How to start and End the Game and Interpreter:
Download swi-prolog interpreter (https://www.swi-prolog.org/) if you haven't already. 
Run it with "swipl -s freecell.pl" to load the file  
Start the game with "freecell."  
There is no error handling so any invalid input will end the game to menu...  
To exit the interpreter type "halt."
